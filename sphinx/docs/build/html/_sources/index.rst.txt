Welcome to Sphinx Example's documentation!
##########################################

Welcome to our Sphinx project example, where we demonstrate the power and versatility of Sphinx documentation tool. Sphinx is a powerful and extensible documentation framework that simplifies the process of creating `high-quality`, `user-friendly` documentation for software projects, APIs, and more. Remember that we are using `python` (`Official Documentation <https://www.python.org/>`__) and **Sphinx** to create the documentation. Follow these steps to install **Sphinx**.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
  
   pip install sphinx
   pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
